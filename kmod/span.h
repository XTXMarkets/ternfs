// Pages are taken out of the list, added to required blocks for fetching,
// filled with data fetched from block services and then assembled back
// maintaining the original order to match file offsets. Each supplied page
// has page->index prefilled as file_offset/PAGE_SIZE. Fetches are done in
// multiple blocks, but only up to the end of the stripe. If more pages are
// needed, separate fetch for the next stripe is kicked off. Fetch is kicked
// off with the same amount of pages in each block, so if any blocks end up
// having fewer pages, additional padding pages are allocated. If any blocks
// fail, the fetch for the rest of the blocks in the stripe and required parity
// blocks is kicked off. These pages and any padding pages have correct
// page->index set to match the file offset and they are added to the extra_pages
// list. It is up to the caller how to handle them.
// If the requested range is larger than span end, the remaining pages are
// dropped with put_page and not filled. The upstream code only really cares that
// the first page is filled in by the readahead code, so returning fewer pages or
// even returning error aggressively is fine.
